This directory contains ClassLoaderHandlers: classes that know how to extract classpath
entries from different ClassLoaders.

You can register your own custom ClassLoaderHandler with FastClasspathScanner by calling
FastClasspathScanner#registerClassLoaderHandler() before calling #scan().

Note that URLClassLoader subclasses do not need a custom ClassLoaderHandler, they are
handled automatically by FastClasspathScanner.

If a new default ClassLoaderHandler is added to FastClasspathScanner, then it should be
added to the list in ClassLoaderHandlerRegistry.
