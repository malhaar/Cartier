/**
 * Stateful delay that increases using decorrelated jitter strategy.
 *
 * <p>
 * Considering retry attempts start at 1, attempt 0 would be the initial call and will always yield 0 (or the lower). Then, each
 * retry step will by default yield {@code min(cap, randomBetween(base, prevDelay * 3))}.
 *
 * This strategy is based on <a href="https://www.awsarchitectureblog.com/2015/03/backoff.html">Exponential Backoff and
 * Jitter</a>.
